step-by-step instructions to run both the backend and React application:

Clone the Repository:
First, clone the repository that contains your backend code and React application to your local machine.

Set Up the Backend:
Navigate to the backend directory in the cloned repository.
Install the required Node.js packages by running: npm install
Make sure you have SQLite installed on your machine.
Create an empty SQLite database file named "devices.db" in the backend directory.
Run the backend server using: npm start
The backend will start running at http://localhost:5001.

Set Up the React Application:
Navigate to the root directory (where the React application is) in the cloned repository.
Install the required Node.js packages by running: npm install
Run the React application using: npm start
The React development server will start at http://localhost:3000, and the application will open automatically in your default web browser.

Database and API Endpoints:
The backend should be connected to the "devices.db" SQLite database and ready to handle API requests.
The React application should communicate with the backend API through endpoints like http://localhost:5001/api/devices to fetch and update data.

Interacting with the Application:
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to access the React application.
The React application should display a list of devices and allow you to add/edit devices using forms.
When you add or edit a device, it will communicate with the backend API to save the data to the database.
